/**
 * AskResolver wrapper that short-circuits permission prompts when the
 * (tool, risk, scope) tuple was previously approved with "yes-and-remember"
 * (the 'a' option) in this task, or when a persisted PROJECT command rule
 * covers the argv (the 'p' option, ADR 0030). On either hit, returns
 * "allow" immediately and writes a dim auto-allow marker so the user can
 * see their earlier choice is still in effect.
 *
 * The policy itself — what counts as covered, which choices to offer, what
 * a grant writes back — is `@herta/core`'s `ApprovalPolicy`, shared with the
 * app-server's overlay resolver; this class only renders and awaits.
