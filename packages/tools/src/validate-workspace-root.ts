/**
 * Canonicalize a workspace root through symlinks (audit S8).
 *
 * `resolveSafePath` realpaths every candidate file and then prefix-compares it
 * against the root. If the root itself is a symlink, those two can never
 * match: with the root at `/tmp/proj`, `a.ts` canonicalizes to
 * `/private/tmp/proj/a.ts`, which does not start with `/tmp/proj`, so EVERY
 * file operation is denied as outside the workspace. That is the whole of
 * macOS's `/tmp` and `/var`, plus any project reached through a symlink or a
 * Windows junction. The test suite already knew: `testing/tmp-workspace.ts`
 * realpaths its own root precisely so the suite does not hit this.
 *
 * NATIVE realpath first (user report 2026-08-24): `resolveSafePath` uses
 * `fsPromises.realpath`, which has native semantics — on Windows it resolves
 * subst and mapped network drives (`F:\ws` → `C:\real\ws` or `\\srv\share\ws`),
 * which the JS `realpathSync` walk does not (a drive mapping is not a reparse
 * point on any path component). A root canonicalized with the JS walk while
 * candidates canonicalize natively re-creates the S8 symptom wholesale for a
 * workspace on a mapped drive: even `resolveSafePath(root, ".")` is denied,
 * so 板砖 cannot run a single command. Both sides must share ONE semantics.
 * The JS walk stays as the middle fallback: on filesystems where the native
 * call fails (some network redirectors), candidate realpaths fail too and
 * `resolveSafePath` degrades to lexical prefix checks — the JS result keeps
 * the root in that same un-resolved spelling, so the two still agree.
 *
 * Falls back to the lexical resolve when the path does not exist — the caller
 * is about to reject it anyway, and a fallback keeps the error "no such
 * directory" instead of an EIO from deep inside a resolver.
