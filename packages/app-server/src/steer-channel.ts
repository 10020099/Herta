/**
 * The steer channel (ADR 0063): user text sent while 板砖 works, held until
 * the backend loop's next sampling boundary drains it.
 *
 * One session owns one channel for its whole life; the backend stack's
 * runtime factory closes over `drain`, so every dispatch reads the same
 * channel. The session pushes at acceptance (after publishing the
 * `user.steer` event that projects the text into the record) and clears at
 * turn end, so a steer accepted in a turn the loop never drained again — an
 * interrupt, a provider failure — cannot leak into the next dispatch as a
 * message from nowhere.
 *
 * Several steers can sit here between two boundaries (the loop's provider
 * call is seconds long); they drain in order. The UI holds ONE pending
 * message at a time (owner 2026-09-14), so in practice the list is one deep.
