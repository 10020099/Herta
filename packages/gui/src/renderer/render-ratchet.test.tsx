/**
 * Render ratchets (2026-09-24): how many components React re-renders for
 * the two things a user does most — type a character, and watch a reply
 * stream in. Counts, not clocks (test-utils/render-census.ts), so they are
 * exact under fake timers and can hold a line in the test gate.
 *
 * A ratchet only turns one way. A count ABOVE its ceiling fails: something
 * now re-renders on every keystroke or every glyph that did not before —
 * find it in the census the failure prints, or raise the ceiling in the same
 * commit that makes the extra renders deliberate, and say why. A count
 * BELOW its ceiling fails too, asking to lower it: the win is locked in the
 * moment it lands, instead of drifting back unnoticed.
 *
 * Method from the claude.ai speed-up (2026-09-23 post): measure a
 * deterministic count, drive it down, ratchet it.
