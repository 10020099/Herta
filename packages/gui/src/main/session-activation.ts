 * Which session the window shows, and the three calls that change it (open,

 * thrown — the window shows the session the host has open, or nothing;
 * never one the host closed (UX review 2026-09-22, item 6). Three paths
 * used to break it and leave the composer enabled on a closed session, every
 * send going nowhere: a superseded open (click A, then B whose file is
 * corrupt — the host kept A, the window kept the session A had closed), a
 * create that failed after the close, a delete that failed after it.
 *
 * Last-CLICK-wins ordering, shared by the renderer's IPC handlers and the
 * tray menu: activations run concurrently, and only the newest may point
 * the window. A superseded one still resolves (harmless) but never
 * re-points — the reconcile after the newest one settles does.
