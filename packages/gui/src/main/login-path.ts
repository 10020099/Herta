/**
 * macOS login-shell PATH recovery (audit 2026-08-05, S7; ADR 0032, amended
 * 2026-09-23).
 *
 * A `.app` launched from Finder, Spotlight, or the Dock inherits launchd's
 * environment, not a shell's — PATH is roughly
 * `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`. Nothing a developer installed is on it:
 * Homebrew (`/opt/homebrew/bin`), nvm/fnm/volta node, pyenv, cargo, rustup,
 * or ripgrep. The same app launched from a terminal works perfectly, which is
 * exactly why this survives casual testing — and why CI cannot catch it
 * either: `mac-build.yml` starts the binary from a bash step that already has
 * the runner's full PATH.
 *
 * The consequences inside Herta are quiet rather than loud:
 *   - `run_command` spawns with `shell: false` and the inherited env, so
 *     `npm test` / `node script.js` / `cargo build` fail as "binary not found"
 *     for a user whose terminal runs them fine;
 *   - `detectRg()` probes bare `rg` ONCE and caches the null for the whole
 *     process lifetime, silently downgrading `search_text` to the slower JS
 *     walker for the rest of the session.
 *
 * So the harness recovers the PATH the user's shell would have, once, at
 * startup. This is HARNESS-set: it does not touch — and must not be confused
 * with — the model-facing `env` allowlist in tools/run-command/env-guard.ts.
 * The model still cannot set PATH; the app simply starts with the right one.
 *
 * Explicitly NOT fixed by running commands through a login shell: that would
 * reopen the shell-body classification class (audit S4) for every command.
 *
 * The 2026-09-23 amendment (the pre-release platform review): the first cut
 * asked `-lc` only, which reads `.zprofile` but not `.zshrc` — where nvm,
 * fnm, conda, pyenv and bun install themselves — and it APPENDED the shell's
 * entries after launchd's, so `/usr/bin/python3` (Apple's) shadowed the
 * user's Homebrew one. Now an interactive login shell is asked too, its answer
 * is read between markers, and the shell's order leads.
