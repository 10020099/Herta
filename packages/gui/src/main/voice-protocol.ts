 * buffered `Response`: the media pipeline needs a SEEKABLE source — for
 * Ogg/Opus it reads the file's TAIL to learn the duration — and a buffered
 * body leaves `<audio>` with `duration: Infinity` and a stalled pipeline
 * (found live, 2026-07-16 opus cutover; hand-rolled 206 Range slices did not
 * heal it either — WAV never exposed this because its duration is in the
 * header). Only the content-type is overridden (file:// guesses none for
 * `.opus`). Missing / oversized / not-a-file / unknown extension → 404,
 * malformed URL → 400 (best-effort: voice is non-essential, so a bad clip
