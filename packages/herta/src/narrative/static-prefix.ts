/**
 * Builder for the Static Herta Prefix — the stable, cache-friendly head
 * of the v0.2 actor's prompt. Per SPEC §4.1, the prefix is:
 *
 *   HertaBio + selected 废案 few-shots + selected 记录 files + EnvSet
 *
 * The body of each top-level section is concatenated with blank-line
 * separators; no outer English markers are emitted (the few-shot files
 * already self-identify via their internal `### 废案_NN：xxx` /
 * `### 记录：xxx` headers, and HertaBio / EnvSet are short enough that
 * adjacent prose suffices).
 *
 * Two tiers (M-prompts-1, 2026-07-05):
 *
 * - HertaBio and EnvSet are IDENTITY — compiled into the bundle via
 *   `PROMPT_ASSETS` (D1: identity lives in the harness, not in
 *   user-editable workspace files; it also must not vanish when the
 *   session workspace isn't this repo). They are no longer read from
 *   `.herta/narrative/` at runtime.
 * - The 废案/记录 few-shots are LIVING MEMORY — still loaded from the
 *   workspace's `.herta/narrative/` because the Dream system writes new
 *   废案 there and cap-eviction archives them. Files whose name starts
 *   with `### 废案` or `### 记录` load in ascending NN order (00, 01, …)
 *   via the lexical `.sort()` below (zero-padded numbers). A fresh
 *   workspace is materialized with the canonical seeds first — see
 *   `materializeSeedFeian`.
 *
 * The prefix is treated as immutable during a turn; runtime facts live in
 * `TerminalRecord`, not by rewriting this prefix.
 *
 * Order rationale: HertaBio establishes voice, the few-shots demonstrate
 * it in action, then EnvSet anchors the current environment right before
 * the turn's running record — putting EnvSet last keeps the most
 * operationally-relevant context closest to the open `（我 说）` tag.
 *
 * The prefix deliberately contains NO session metadata (sessionId, ISO
 * timestamps, workspace path). Such bookkeeping belongs in the JSONL
 * session header (`V2RecordPersister.forNewSession`) and in the
 * `/resume` picker — it does not belong inside Herta's in-voice prompt
 * context. See Slice 8 design doc §3 decision E.
