/**
 * Shared slow-stream reveal DRIVER (consolidation, arch-audit backlog item
 * 2026-07: "consolidate the duplicated slow-stream reveal state machine").
 *
 * Before this module, the timer/cursor state machine that paces Herta's
 * speech existed three times — `BusActorStreamingSink.slowStreamSpeech`,
 * `BusActorStreamingSink.slowStreamSpeechLive` (both in
 * `packages/app-server/src/bus-streaming-sink.ts`), and the CLI
 * `NarrativeRenderer.runSlowStream` (`packages/cli/src/render/
 * narrative-renderer.ts`) — and had drifted twice (the non-live word branch
 * missed the fastForwarding hold-cap escape; the live path missed fence
 * handling). The pure DECISION functions were already shared
 * (slow-stream-pacing.ts); this module owns the LOOP:
 *
 *   - the growing code-point buffer + cursor (`pushToken` / `finishInput`)
 *   - the setTimeout tick chain, starvation return + re-arm
 *   - verdictPending wiring (resolve/reject both open the gate and restart
 *     the reveal-ceiling anchor)
 *   - the supervised front-gate (backlog threshold + finishInput front-load)
 *   - the fence branch (length-keyed region cache, closed/settled semantics,
 *     atomic emit clamped to the verdict hold)
 *   - the word branch (unit emit, partial-word hold with the CJK exemption,
 *     hold cap WITH the fastForwarding escape)
 *   - the char branch (one code point per emit, humanized cadence)
 *   - pacingDecision ramp/hold, the wall-clock reveal ceiling
 *   - flushTail (interrupt/ceiling), fastForward (paced OK-verdict drain),
 *     cancel (terminal reject; the SINK owns its own retract/erase visuals)
 *
 * The driver is LIVE-shaped. A fixed-text stream is the degenerate call
 * pattern `pushToken(text); finishInput()` — with `inputFinished` true from
 * the first tick, the live-only guards (partial-word hold, fence settled
 * check, ceiling `inputFinished` gate, tail ramp gate) all reduce exactly to
 * the historical non-live semantics.
 *
 * Sinks stay data-in/callback-out: they provide `emitRange` (GUI publishes a
 * bus delta; the CLI writes the chunk and records per-code-point widths for
 * its column-accurate retract), `onBegin`/`onFinish` (begin/end stream
 * discipline), and knobs for the two pinned per-sink differences:
 *
 *   - `completionTick` — the CLI historically finishes on a SEPARATE tick
 *     after the last unit (its tests pin the trailing `\n` arriving one
 *     base-delay later, and the extra `revealUnitDelay` random draw); the
 *     GUI finishes on the emitting tick.
 *   - `fences` — the CLI has never had the slice-5 atomic fence emit; on a
 *     styled TTY each write carries its own ANSI wrap, so enabling it would
 *     change the zh byte stream. It keeps pacing fences like prose.
 *   - `maxRevealMs` — the CLI has no reveal ceiling; it passes Infinity.
 *   - `firstDelayMs` — the CLI's first tick is a humanized delay (consumes
 *     one `random` draw at construction); the GUI's is plain `baseMs`.
 *
 * One deliberate unification (unobservable via timers): the fence branch's
 * verdict-hold cap now carries the same `fastForwarding` escape as the word
 * branch and the live variant (`!fastForwarding && inputFinished &&
 * !verdictResolved`), where the historical non-live branch used bare
 * `verdictResolved ? total : holdIndex`. The two differ only when a tick
 * fires with `fastForwarding && !verdictResolved` — impossible in practice,
 * because fastForward re-arms on a MACROtask while the verdictPending
 * settlement that flips `verdictResolved` is a MICROtask queued before it.
