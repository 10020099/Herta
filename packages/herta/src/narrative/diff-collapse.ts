/**
 * Diff-fence collapsing for system block bodies. Used in two places:
 *
 *   1. **CLI renderer** (`@herta/cli` `narrative-renderer.ts`): collapse
 *      long diffs in the on-screen `→ 系统` block so the terminal isn't
 *      flooded with hundred-line patches. Operator-tunable via
 *      `HERTA_DIFF_PREVIEW_MAX_LINES` (the CLI calls
 *      `resolveDiffPreviewMaxLines()` to read that env var).
 *
 *   2. **LLM prompt serializer** (`serialize.ts`): collapse long diffs
 *      in the serialized record passed to the LLM so multi-hundred-line
 *      patches don't eat the model's context window. Operator-tunable
 *      via `HERTA_DIFF_PROMPT_MAX_LINES`. The full diff stays in
 *      `TerminalRecord` and in the JSONL transcript on disk — only the
 *      LLM's view is compressed. (N6, 2026-05-23.)
 *
 * Both call-sites resolve their own max-lines so the CLI's render
 * truncation and the LLM's prompt truncation can be tuned independently.
 *
 * Function shape: collapse `\`\`\`diff … \`\`\`` fenced blocks inside
 * `body` to at most `maxLines` diff lines, appending a one-line
 * `… (N more lines suppressed — full diff in evidence)` footer. Fence
 * opens/closes themselves are preserved (we collapse the CONTENT, not
 * the wrapper) so downstream syntax-aware viewers still see a valid
 * fenced block.
 *
 * Returns the body unchanged when `maxLines === Infinity` (operator
 * opt-out).
 *
 * `lang` picks the footer's prose (`compaction-text.ts`) — it is the
 * only localized part, and both call-sites above have a session
 * language to hand. It defaults to `en` rather than the repo-wide `zh`
 * purely for back-compat: this is a pure exported function whose
 * historical footer was English, and the default keeps a caller that
 * knows no language producing exactly the bytes it always did.
