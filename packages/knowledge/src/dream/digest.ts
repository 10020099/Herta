/**
 * Which system blocks belong in a dream episode's evidence spine — and
 * which are live-work chrome that would only hand the worthiness gate
 * noise it then has to reject (consumer audit 2026-07-23).
 *
 * Skipped, by digest kind:
 *  - "bg"   — a background command's start, its polls while running and
 *             an explicit stop: transient run state. Its EXIT row stays —
 *             that is an outcome, and a background test run's verdict used
 *             to reach the dream only through the marker's tail (dream
 *             review 2026-09-22, finding 17).
 *  - "todo" — the plan layout block: working state (same rationale as
 *             the live compaction's Planning/todo skip).
 *  - "patch" / "skip" — patch previews, i.e. the FULL diff body. The
 *             Writing op row (with its `↳ +N −M`) and the done-marker
 *             already carry the outcome; a dream prompt has no use for a
 *             hundred-line diff. The projector has emitted `patch` since
 *             2026-08-25 and the skip list never learned it — every
 *             coding episode carried its diffs into every distillation
 *             call and past the 200-char floor (dream review 2026-09-22,
 *             finding 1). `skip` is the older kind; records persisted
 *             before the digest field existed are matched by body prefix.
 *
 * Everything else — op rows, test results, tool failures, markers,
 * plain text — returns its body verbatim: that is what actually
 * happened, which is exactly what the dream should ground in.

 * (ADR 0033) are the case that forced this apart. Their `evidenceDetail` holds
 * the head of a document the 开拓者 uploaded — the one payload in the record
 * that never came from the repo, the backend, or Herta — and dreams distil into
 * a first-person autobiography that persists across sessions. She should
 * remember being handed a spec; the spec's contents are not hers to keep.
 *
 * So the citation in `body` stays (that is what happened) and the detail is
 * dropped. Repo excerpts, search hits and command output are bounded work
 * evidence and have ridden into dreams since ADR 0027 — except where they
 * READ the attachment store (ADR 0069 §5): the fold's own hint sends Herta
 * back to the document through 板砖, and an excerpt of it, a search hit in
 * it or a `cat` of it carried the same text the attachment row withholds.
 * The rule is keyed on where the text came from, not on the row's kind.
 * `outputFromAttachmentStore` says the command whose output this row
 * carries named the store — an output row does not carry its command, so
 * the caller tracks it (`buildEpisodeDigest`).
