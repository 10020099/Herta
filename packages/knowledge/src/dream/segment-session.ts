   *    conversation does, so a long run is one episode from the ask to the
   *    verdict (bounded in time by `maxEpisodeMs`) instead of being chopped
   *    into chunks that separate the verdict from the ask.
   * A block stamped before it, or unstamped, follows the old rules, so every
   * episode dreamed before the cutover keeps its hash. The dream manifest
   * records the cutover the first time a pass runs with these rules
   * (`DreamManifest.segmentationV2Since`); every segmenter that must agree
   * with the ledger reads it from there. Absent → the old rules everywhere.

 * BETWEEN blocks — applied to the silence after the record's end. Without
 * this, every markerless (typically non-coding) session is one permanently
 * unsettled trailing episode and structurally invisible to the dream digest
 * — the bias that kept both E2E grief sessions out of the corpus while
 * done-marker-bounded commissions dreamed freely.
 *
 * Resume safety: if the session resumes after such a gap, the between-block
 * gap rule inserts a boundary at the same spot, so the resumed content forms
 * a NEW episode; the settled tail's blocks — and therefore its episodeHash —
 * are unchanged, and the manifest dedup keeps it single-dreamed.
 *
 * The silence is measured from the tail's last STAMPED block (the caller
 * walks back past unstamped ones); only a tail with no stamped block at all
 * cannot prove silence and stays unsettled (ADR 0024, amended 2026-09-23).
