/**
 * Retention strength of a dream-created 废案 — computed on demand, never stored
 * (a stored value would go stale the moment the clock moved). Models the
 * forgetting curve from `docs/what-is-memory.md` §6/§7:
 *
 *   strength = salience · exp(−Δdays / halfLife) · (1 + k·ln(1 + reactivations))
 *
 * - salience: the birth voice score × (1 + w·emotionalCharge) — what got the
 *   dream kept, amplified by how much the episode moved her (affect-weighted
 *   salience / flashbulb encoding, ADR 0023). Legacy records carry no stored
 *   charge → charge 0 → pure voice, byte-identical to the pre-charge formula.
 * - exp(−Δ/halfLife): the decay curve. Δ is time since the *last reactivation*
 *   (falling back to birth), so a reactivated dream resets its clock.
 * - (1 + k·ln(1+n)): usefulness bump — concave, so repeated reactivation matters
 *   with diminishing returns and never runs away.
 *
 * Pure: `nowMs` is passed in (no `Date.now()` inside), matching the pass's
 * `now`-threading so it stays deterministic under test.
