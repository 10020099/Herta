/**
 * Reopen own-dream filter (design 2026-07-07).
 *
 * When a session is reopened after a Dream pass has distilled some of its
 * episodes into 废案, the static prefix would otherwise carry a "past memory"
 * of events that still sit verbatim in the reopened record below it — Herta
 * remembering the ongoing conversation as if from another life. This module
 * decides which dreamed 废案 to withhold from ONE session-open's prefix:
 *
 * - Source episode still verbatim in the prompt window (at/after the recap
 *   boundary, or no recap engaged at all) → EXCLUDE: pure duplication.
 * - Source episode behind the recap boundary → INCLUDE: its detail survives
 *   only as a line of the ≤maxRecapChars recap, so the 废案 is recovered
 *   information, not duplication.
 * - Source episodes from other sessions → INCLUDE (hashes never match this
 *   record's segmentation, so this falls out of the matching rule).
 *
 * Matching is by episode content hash against a deterministic re-segmentation
 * of the current record: appending blocks only ever creates NEW episodes
 * (a dreamable episode is always closed by a ≥episodeGapMs gap, because the
 * Dream trigger requires an idle window longer than that gap), so hashes of
 * previously dreamed episodes are stable across the record's growth.
 *
 * The exclusion is per-prompt only — the 废案 file, its manifest entry, and
 * its retention/reactivation bookkeeping are untouched; other sessions and
 * later opens see it normally.
