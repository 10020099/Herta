 *  - prune phantom live records whose 废案 file has vanished (deleted

 * It deliberately does NOT adopt untracked `### 废案` files into the ledger: a
 * 废案 file absent from the manifest is indistinguishable from a hand-authored
 * seed, and claiming a user-owned seed as dream-created would expose it to
 * cap-eviction — a violation of the never-touch-user-owned guard (D7). Because
 * the pass now flushes the manifest after every episode, a promotion is tracked
 * the instant it lands; the only untracked promotion is one killed in the
 * microsecond between the file rename and that flush, which is then left live
 * and unmanaged, exactly like a seed (safe, never re-promoted to a live dup
 * thanks to the title/similarity gates).
