 * The part of a permission ask that is POLICY, not presentation (D4): which
 * asks never reach the user because a task-scoped remember (ADR 0026) or a
 * persisted project rule (ADR 0030) already covers them, which persistence
 * offers the surface may show, and what a granted persistence writes back.
 *
 * Both user-facing resolvers — the CLI's `CachingAskResolver` (stdout
 * prompt) and the app-server's `OverlayAskResolver` (GUI overlay) — carried
 * their own copy of this until 2026-08-19, and every audit fix to the policy
 * (T3.4 scoped cache keys, BL15 cwd-scoped rules, ADR 0040 bash argv) had to
 * land twice. One policy object; the resolvers only render and await.
 *
 * Every decision re-derives from the LIVE request: a caller can never pass a
 * rule shape of its own, and the rule-eligibility gate (`isRuleEligibleAskCode`)
 * runs on the ask code the rule authored, so a hand-edited rules file can
 * never cover a destructive/network/reader ask.
